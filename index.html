            is an Australian praise and worship group from Sydney, Australia,
            where they started making music in 1983 at Hillsong Church. Fifteen
            of their songs have appeared on the Billboard magazine charts in the
            US, with
            <span class="heading-content__bio--span"
              >"What a Beautiful Name"</span
            >
            (2016) representing their greatest success, reaching platinum in the
            US. This band is my personal favorite,
            <span class="heading-content__bio--span"
              >especially since the songs are such a great inspiration to
              me.</span
            >
            The band was originally formed in 1998, by close friends from within
            the youth ministry called "Powerhouse Youth", led by Hillsong Youth
            Pastors Phil and Lucinda Dooley for many years.[1] As the house band
            for the Powerhouse meetings, the group played original songs and
            rearranged popular radio tunes at their weekly meeting for local
            youth aged 16–25. Band members sometimes also contributed to the
            larger interdenominational ministry Youth Alive Australia and its
            albums. Most members of the band also attended Hillsong Church
            services.
